## Unveiling Customer Behavior through Association Analysis

 - This project focuses on performing Market Basket Analysis to gain insights into customer behavior.
 - By analyzing transactional data from a retail business, we aim to uncover valuable patterns and associations among purchased items.
 - These insights can provide actionable information to enhance decision-making processes, ultimately driving increased sales and customer satisfaction.
 - Each Phase focuses on specific aspects of such as Loading the Dataset,Data Preprocessing,Association Analysis,Generating Insights.

#  Project Overview
## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to apply Association Analysis techniques to the provided dataset, sourced from Kaggle's Market Basket Analysis competition. By following a structured approach, we seek to extract meaningful insights and generate actionable recommendations for our retail business client.

## Approach
This project follows a phased approach to effectively solve the problem and deliver meaningful results:
- **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset, containing transactional data including BillNo, Date, and Itemname columns, is loaded into the notebook for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Various preprocessing steps are applied to prepare the data for association analysis, such as handling missing values and transforming the data into the required format.
- **Association Analysis:** Market Basket Analysis techniques, such as Apriori algorithm, are utilized to uncover frequent itemsets and generate association rules from the transaction data.
- **Generating Insights:** The discovered association rules are analyzed to extract actionable insights that can drive business decisions and strategies.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pandas
- mlxtend
- Other required libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)

## Dataset Source

- The Dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis).
- We Uploaded the Dataset as Input from the Kaggle Notebook Itself.
